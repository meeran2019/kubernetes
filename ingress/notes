This involves nginx ingress controller and ingress resources.

https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/


Installation:

    1. To refer the documentation and follow the procedure of manifest.
    2. common/default-server-secret.yaml - Use our certificate and key instead of default one.
    3. common/ingress-class.yaml - Update the annotation, so this ingress class is default assign to new ingresses without ingressClassName.
    4. Custom resource definition - By default, it is required to create custom resource definitions for VirtualServer, VirtualServerRoute, TransportServer and Policy. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller pods will not become Ready
    5. service/loadbalancer-aws-elb.yaml  -> This create network load balancer. 
        NOTE: AWS ELB IP address are not static, so DNS name should be used. 
    6. Created the pod and exposed the service to that pod.

    With HTTP:

        1. Created the ingress resource (refer nginx-ingress-http.yaml)

    With HTTPS (Decrypt happen on ingress):

        1. refer the nginx-ingress-https.yaml
        2. 


Issues Faced: 
    1. Cannot generate self signed certificate as FQDN is longer.
